Melting Point Prediction Model
Project Overview
A machine learning regression model developed to predict chemical compound melting points (°C) using Group feature representations. The model processes multivariate chemical descriptor data to deliver accurate temperature predictions for industrial and research applications.

Technical Implementation

Data: Multi-feature dataset with 100+ Group columns + id identifier

Target: Melting point temperatures (continuous regression)

Features: Chemical group descriptors (Group 1, 2, 15, 20, 29, 31, 41, 123, 180, etc.)
